 	ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Petro Mozil, a student at UCU.

I'm currenly learning category theory and processor architecture.

I'm good at C, Haskell, lua, bash, JS (mostly the web dev thingies) and Python.

*Also, HTML+CSS form a fully functional imperative language.*

**Also also, tomasulo's algorithm is gonna fall apart soon,
we can't keep stringing more and more registers together.
We gotta create something new, something \*functional\***

***Also  also also, a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors***
